# Predicting Hotel Cancellations with Machine Learning

The purpose of this project is to predict hotel cancellations and ADR (average daily rate) values for two separate Portuguese hotels (H1 and H2). Included in the GitHub repository are the datasets and notebooks for all models run.

The original datasets and research by Antonio et al. can be found here: [Using Data Science to Predict Hotel Booking Cancellations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191). All other relevant references have been cited in the below articles.
